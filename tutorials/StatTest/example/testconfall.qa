# Configuration file for QA tests
# This file should be a valid python file.
# To test if format is correct, tye:
# python testconf.qa
# no output is produced if the code is correct
#
# The general format is:
#     variable = value
# There are few top-level variables: Binned and UnBinned for
# binned and unbinned distributions respectively.
# The value of the top-level variables is a dictionary of variable:values pairs.
# See the following file as an example: <StatTest main Direcotry>/example/testconf.qa

#Configuration for Binned distributions
#These are tests to be performed on Histograms
Binned = {
    #Define the Test to be executed by Default
    #If a test is specified for a specific histogram the latter will overwrite this
    #Availble tests are defined in module: StatTest.Tests, there the function
    # getTestByName is used to retrieve the test class corresponding to the name
    #Specified here
    'DefaultTestName' : 'BinnedWeighted1DChi2Test',
    #Define the default thresholds for the test.
    #These are used together with the test above
    #Three special cases could be useful in special cases
    # If Thresholds : [ 0 , 0 ] It will cause the test to always PASS (basically disabble test)
    # If Thresholds : [ 0 , 1 ] Test will always be NOTPASSED (useful to force user to check results manually)
    # If Thresholds : [ 1 , 1 ] Test will always FAIL
    'DefaultThresholds' : [ 0.1,0.5],

    #Define the default file from where retrieve the reference histograms.
    #Reference histograms should have the same name (including ROOT's directory structure)
    #of the tested histogram.
    #Reference file is searched in working directory
    'DefaultReferenceFile' : 'reference.root',
    #It is possible to access remote files via HHTP (See documentation of ROOT's TWebFile'
    #'DefaultReferenceFile' : 'http://someserver.org/somerootfile.root',

    #Define inputs: histograms a list of dictionaries
    'Histos' : [
        #Each dictionary represents a configuration for a set of histograms.
        #At least one configuration should be defined.

        #Group 1

            #The first element of the configuration is the name of the histogram
            #  to be tested, the name can be an absolute path or a regular experession
            #  For example the following is a configuration for an histogram 
            'Name' : '.*',
            #The second element is the test name, if not given the value in DefaultTestName
            #will be used
            #'TestName' : 'AndersonDarlingTest',
            #The third element are the thresholds. This is a couple of p-values, if
            #the result of the test (p-value) between the histogram and the reference is lower than
            #the first element the test is FAILED, if larger than thge second element is PASSED,
            #otherwise is NOTPASSED. If no thresholds are given the default will be used (see:
            # Interface.Output class)
            #'Thresholds' : [ 0.1 , 0.7 ]
        },
