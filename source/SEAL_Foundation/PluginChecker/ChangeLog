	* SealModuleSymCheck: Accept more variety of output from "ldd".
	On SuSE 9.3 "ldd" can output "libfoo.so => (hex-address)", without
	path after the arrow, and "/lib/libfoo.so (hex-address)", without
	arrow and just the lone full path name.  Reported by Zhen Xie and
	Stephan Wynhoff.

	they are defined.  Occurs with certain GL libraries.  Simply be
	be conservative when "nm" doesn't understand a binary.

	* SealModuleSymCheck: Always ignore some internal symbols
	that SealBase references but are only defined in binaries.
	Filter out some common but harmless warnings from ldd.
